Magic Mirror <--> Digital Picture Frame

This is more of an alternate usage of a Magic Mirror or not.
After a while of inaction (5 - 10 min.) switch to a Digital Picture Frames display.
Yeah I know it takes away the mirror usage but makes the display really display something.
One would have to pull images from some other source like an attached HD or maybe from the net.
Just a thought!
